# Name Card (Flask local server + HTML5 Website Template

This is a simply way, how can we create an online name card with beautiful HTML5 template + JavaScript + CSS. I used a Python Flask server to my local envirament (backend side). While Flask will render our template from external folders: I created a "templates" folder for index.html and an another one "static" folder for the images, js files, and css files, fonts, etc.

I attached a screenchot picture also from my browser.
